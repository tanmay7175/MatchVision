MatchVision: Cross-Camera Player Re-Identification
MatchVision is an end-to-end system for identifying and matching football players captured from different camera angles using deep learning techniques. It combines YOLOv5 for player detection, ResNet for feature extraction, and cosine similarity for re-identification.

Key Features
Player Detection: Uses a YOLOv5 model trained to detect players in match footage.

Feature Extraction: ResNet-based embeddings for each detected player crop.

Cross-View Matching: Cosine similarity is used to match players from two different video sources.

Annotation and Visualization: Player IDs are annotated on the video frames.

Evaluation: Compares predicted matches against ground truth using accuracy score.

python main.py
ðŸ§  Model Architecture
Detection: YOLOv5 (best.pt)

Embedding Extraction: ResNet pretrained on ImageNet

Matching: Cosine similarity between player features

ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation
Match accuracy is computed by comparing predicted player matches with a ground truth CSV. Accuracy is reported as a percentage.

ðŸ’¡ Future Enhancements
Add support for real-time processing using webcam/live stream.

Improve feature robustness using Siamese or Triplet Networks.

Include pose or temporal tracking information for better accuracy.
